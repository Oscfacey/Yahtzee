# Yahtzee
## Project Overview
This project is an implementation of the classic dice game "Yahtzee" using Python. Yahtzee is a popular game that involves rolling dice and strategically selecting combinations to maximize your score. In this project, I developed a text-based version of the game where players can roll dice, keep the ones they want, and score points based on different combinations.

## Key Features
Dice Rolling: Players can roll a set of dice to get random values.

Dice Locking: Players can choose which dice to lock and which ones to re-roll.

Scoring: The game evaluates and scores different combinations, such as ones, twos, threes, etc., based on the player's current dice.

Game Rules: The project implements the official Yahtzee scoring rules.

Turn-Based: The game is turn-based, allowing multiple players to take turns.

Winner Determination: The game determines the winner based on the total scores at the end of the specified number of rounds.

## What I Worked On
Game Logic: I designed and implemented the core game logic, including dice rolling, scoring, and turn management.

User Interface: I created a text-based user interface to display game information and receive player input.

Scoring Algorithm: I developed an algorithm to calculate scores based on the player's dice and chosen combination.

Multiplayer Support: The game supports multiple players, and I implemented the logic for turn rotation.

Error Handling: I included error handling to ensure a smooth user experience and prevent invalid moves.

Game Flow: I managed the flow of the game, including starting, playing, and ending rounds.

## Technologies Used
Python 

Standard libraries for input/output and random number generation

## During this project, I gained valuable experience in several areas:
Python Programming: I improved my Python coding skills and gained a better understanding of data structures and control flow.

Algorithm Design: I developed an algorithm to evaluate different dice combinations, which improved my problem-solving abilities.

User Interface Design: I worked on designing a user-friendly text-based interface to enhance the player experience.

Game Logic: I learned how to implement complex game rules and manage game state efficiently.

Error Handling: I became proficient in handling errors and exceptions to create a robust application.
